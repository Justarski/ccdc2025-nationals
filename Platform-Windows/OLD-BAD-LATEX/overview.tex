\section{Introduction}
The goal of these documents is to provide a baseline foundation for the Windows team members.
Please update and improve the documentation wherever you see fit.

\paragraph{Categories} I think there are 8 categories to cover. Each category has an associated folder

\begin{enumerate}
        \item Deployment to Proxmox
        \item Setup of Active Directory
        \item Setup of the CA
        \item Setup of the DFS / highly available files
        \item Hardening
        \item Planning (for the competition, timelines)
        \item Offense (to practice)
        \item Powershell commands (to reference in one spot)
\end{enumerate}

This is my knowledge of Windows. I have tried to include everything I think could be useful to you.
I encourage you to do the same,to  add more sections and flesh out the sections with your own experience.

\paragraph{Sharing files from Remmina}
You will be using Remmina a lot, make sure to click "share folder" to send files over RDP.
The folder is visible under "This PC".
Windows defender can remove files from the share folder.

\paragraph{Unpatched CVEs}
There could be unpatched CVEs during the competition. A list of them can be found \href{https://stack.watch/product/microsoft/windows-server-2019/}{here}.
For example, CVE-2020-0796 was severe and would surely have been used by the red team.
