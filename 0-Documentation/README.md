# Documentation

This directory will contain the **DOCUMENTATION** we may find useful for a quick reference. This is mainly for manual tasks we will have to do, this includes steps for configuring services, kicking off the red team, and even where to find online resources. 

There are **three** classes of documents that will be stored in this directory:
1) Non-Printed Reference Documents: These are documents we create that will only be hosted in this GitHub repository. They should be written in **Markdown** following any style guides that have been specified.   
2) Printed Reference Documents: These are documents that we create to print and store in a *Binder* and will be written in **LaTeX** following any style guides that have been specified. 
3) Incident & Inject Templates: These are documents that we use as templates for Incident and Inject responses; They are `.docx` or `LaTeX` documents.
